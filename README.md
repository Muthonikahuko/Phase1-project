# Microsoft Studio Recommendations
Author: Muthoni Kahuko
#Overview
This project analyzes different movie data frames that contain movie listings ratings and gross earnings from 2011 - 2018

# Business Problem
Microsoft currently wants to open
a new movie studio, they need recommendations on what films are doing well in order to know what films to create

# Data
I used 3 data frames:
1. IMDB.TITLE.BASICS
2. IMDB.TITLE.RATINGS
3. BOM.MOVIE_GROSS

# Methods used to give recommendation
In order to give a conclusive recommendation I used the following steps:
- Data Cleaning
- Merging data frames
- Analyzing the data
- Visualization of the data
  
# Results
We discovered Bv has the highest ranking among the studios and Comedy does well as a genre

# Conslusion
This analysis leads to 2 recommendations in order to have a successful studio:
- Benchmarking from BV studios who have had the highest gross earnings over the years. as well as having 4 movies in the top 5
- Microsoft should venture into Comedy, drama, or Documentaries as they have the highest Domestic gross as well as merging genres

# Next Steps
Further analyses could yield additional insights to further execute a successful studio
- Instead of using just the domestic gross we could use the foreign gross and widen the scope of data
- Model for each genre and the trajectory of its performance based on the past
